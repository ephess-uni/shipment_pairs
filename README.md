# Group Activity
This activity is an exercise in software testing using Pytest. In this activity, your 
group will create a minimal set of Pytest tests for the functions `remove_intra()` and 
`collect_pairs()` which are present in the `shipment_pairs` module. 

# Create Tests
Tests should be written in the `tests/test_shipment_pairs.py` module.

## Number of tests
This is flexible.  Your group will want to assure that each function performs as 
expected for a variety of inputs--not just one.  

## Test naming convention
While there are many robust naming conventions for test cases, here we just need to 
make sure that our test functions begin with the word `test`.
